52 card deck: 4 of each card (one of each suit/naipe)

J/Q/K = 10 points
2 - 10 = Face value (2 = points, 3 = 3 points...)
Ace = 1 or 11 points (whichever is better for the player)

PLAYING:
1 - user places bet
2 - 2 cards are dealt to the player (and 2 are dealt to the dealer, one is shown and the other is kept facing down)
3 - player chooses to either buy a card ("hit")(you can keep buying until you decide to stay) or "stay" (not buying any more cards)
    If your amount goes over 21, you lose
4 - Dealers reveals the hidden card
    If the player's amount is higher than the dealer's, player wins his bet (gets the same amount he betted?)
    else, if it's a tie, nothing happens, player gets his original bet
    else, dealer wins

Rules:
BLACKJACK:      If the player's first two cards sums to 21, it's a Blackjack. He gets 3 chips to each 2 chips he betted
SPLIT:          If the player is dealt two of the same card, he has the option to split them: They are aplit and you need to bet the same amount of chips for the split. Then each split gets a second card and each split is hit/stay separetdly (you get two games, basically)
DOUBLE DOWN:    When the sum of the first two cards equals 9, 10 or 11, the player can double down, which means he has to double the bet and he gets only one card and is forced to stay
PUSH:           If the player and dealer tie, nothing happens, the player gets his original bet
DEALER:         The dealer is forced to HIT if his two cards amount to 16 or less and is forced to STAY if his first two cards equals 17 or more
BUST:           If the amount goes over 21
